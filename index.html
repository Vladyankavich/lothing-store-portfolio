        <h1>Philip Emeagwali</h1>
        <p><b>Philip Emeagwali is a Nigerian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist">computer scientist.</a>  He has been living in the United States for many years.[1] He won the 1989 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Bell_Prize">Gordon Bell Prize</a>  ($1,000) for<br>
        price-performance in high-performance computing applications, in an oil reservoir modeling calculation using a novel mathematical formulation and<br>
        implementation.[2][3]</b></p>
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Emeagwali was born in Acure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early schooling was suspended in 1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served<br>
        in the Biafran army. After the war he completed high-school equivalence through self-study. He is married to Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American<br>
        microbiologist.</p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p><i>He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship following completion of a correspondence course at the University of London. He received a<br>
        bachelor's degree in mathematics from Oregon State University in 1977. He later moved to Washington DC, receiving in 1986 a master's degree from George<br>
        Washington University in ocean and marine engineering, and a second master's in applied mathematics from the University of Maryland. Next magazine suggested<br>
        that Emeagwali claimed to have further degrees.[6][7] During this time, he worked as a civil engineer at the Bureauof Land Reclamation in Wyoming.</i></p>
        <h3>Court case and the denial of degree</h3>
        <p>Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D.degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991. His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external<br>
        examiners and thus he was not awarded the degree. Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that the decision was a violation of his civil rights and that the<br>
        university had discriminated against him in severalways because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state Court of<br>
        Appeals.[8]</p>
        <h2>Supercomputing</h2>
        <p><i>Emeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of the CM-2 massively-parallel computer. The aplication used computational fluiddynamics for<br>
        oil-reservoir modeling. He received a prize in "price/performance" category, with a performance figure of about 400 Mflops/$1M.[15] The winner in the<br>
        "performance" category, was also the winner of the Price/performance category, but unable to receive two prizes. Mobil Research and Thinking Machines, used the<br>
        CM-2 forseismic data processing and achieved the higher ratio of 500 Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on one award per entry.[3][2] His method involved each<br>
        microprocessor communicating with six neighbors.[10]</i></p>
        <p><b>Emeagwali simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach to reservoir modeling.[1]</b></p>
        <h2>Accolades</h2>
        <p>Price/perfomance-1989 Gordon Bell Prize, IEEE ($1,000prize)[3]<br>
        New African "35th-greatest African (and greatest African scientist) of all time"[16]<br>
        He was cited by Bill Clinton asan example of what Nigerians can achieve when given the opportunity[17] and is frequently featured in popular press articles for<br>
        Black History Month.[18][10]</p>
